# DASHWINK

##### Basic:
  - React + Redux
  - Babel 6 w/ basic presets and transform
  - Webpack w/ basic dev and prod configurations
  - Express development server; easily roll out a production enabled server of your own
  - Eslint w/ basic configs
  - Redux DevTools + Logger middleware - easily removable/replaceable based on your needs

##### Optional:
  - *React Router + bindings (checkout `react-router-redux` branch for more info)*

***

### Requirements
  - `node 5.0.0` and higher!
    - [*you can use a version manager like `n`*](https://github.com/tj/n)

***

### Usage

##### Getting Started:

Install required dependencies.
(*Did you make sure you have the right version of Node?*)
```
npm install
```

Run development server, complete with DevTools and related configuration.
```
npm run dev
```

You're now ready to get working! *(enter command or visit via browser directly)*
```
open http://localhost:3000/
```

***

##### Next Steps & Other Notes:

Now that your development server is up and running, you will see that you have your Redux DevTools available for you to use. The keyboard shortcuts available follow the generally accepted config - but you're free to make changes to them here: `containers/DevTools.js`.

***To toggle the DevTool panel during development:***
<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>H</kbd>

***Change the DevTool panel's position during development:***
<kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd>
